# poc-zeppelin
This repository contains a PoC of Apache Zeppelin, to be familiarized with its use and customization.

### Points for the PoC:

- Basic installation
- Add a new interpreter (a new programming language not supported)
- More than a tool to discover, analyze or visualize data... could be used as an useful notebook of a specific language? For example, could it be used as another way to offer the BEEVA internal formation for a specific programming language or framework? Could it be a good alternative to Jupyter?
- Could it be a good alternative to represent data instead of Kibana for ElasticSearch data? 
- Could it be usefull to make a live demo?
